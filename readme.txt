Why our project is worth 100 points: We have implemented a game that involves letters falling from the top of the screen and a character which moves along the bottom that has a shooting capability. The objective of the game is decently complex, and thus there was a lot of coding that had to go into this. Additionally, the game has sound that can be turned on and off (another feature). 

CSS3 features: The title of the game changes colors repeatedly.
There are two tabs (home and instructions) that change color based on which page the user is currently on.
Additionally, the words for the computer and the player display at the bottom of the screen in different colors. When a letter is gained for either the computer or the player these boxes change to black so that the player can see the letters remaining. 


Note: index.html would pass all certifications except the part that was included to implement the HI-SCORE API.
